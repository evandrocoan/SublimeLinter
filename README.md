## About SublimeLinter

A framework for interactive code linting in [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/3).


## Key Bindings

SublimeLinter comes with some pre-defined keyboard shortcuts. You can customize these via the Package Settings menu.

| Command         | Linux & Windows  | MacOS                  |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Lint this view  | CTRL + K, L      | CTRL + CMD + L         |
| Show all errors | CTRL + K, A      | CTRL + CMD + A         |

Navigating to the next/previous error is done using the `next_result` and `prev_result` commands already built into Sublime Text.


## Support & Bugs

Please use the debug mode and include all console output, and your settings in your bug report. If your issue is specific to a particular linter, please report it on that linter's repository instead.
